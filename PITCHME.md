## What can we audit?

### ‚¨á THE THINGS ‚¨á

@ul

- Performance
- SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
- Best Practices
- PWA (Progressive Web App)
- Accessibility

  @snap[south-west span-100 text-11]
  Chris DeMars ‚óÜ @saltnburnem

@snapend
Note:

- Performance as far as loading, specifically DomContentLoaded, time to first byte, first contentful paint, and optimizing the critical rendering path.
- Search engine optimzation, using the proper heading level elements, keywords, and description.
- Best practices, are you using the proper doctype, are there any console errors?
- For PWA's do you have a service worker and manifest file?
- My favorite topic, accessibility, how is the color contrast? Do you have alternative text for images? Are you using ARIA correctly?

Note:

- This a screenshot of the performance tab in Chrome's DevTools. Based on the results you get from an audit you can really dig down into this chart and see load times, bottlenecks, etc.
- You can also pair this performance tab up with running your audit and compare and contrast the issues.

@snapend
Note:

- All three of these attribute values have to do with the act of opening a link or tab in a web experience.
- The noopenere and noreferrer work against mailicious attacks caused by using the \_blank attribute value of the target attribute. This value gives access to the window.object and therefore partially links to the tab you just came from.
- When adding noopener and noreferrer it doesn't set the window.property and returns a null value.
- According to Point Jupiter, the rule general rule to use nofollow is on links and in forums.

Note:

- According my friend Matt Gaunt over at Google, a service worker is: A script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction.
- Two things you need to have a great progressive web app experience is a service worker javascript file and a manifest.json file.
- To install a service worker you need to register it in your page. This tells the browser where your service worker JS file lives. The code checks to see if it is available and if it is, it is registered once the page loads.

- Set the splash screen
